# Circular Buffer – Readers and Writers (Java)

This project implements a circular buffer in Java that solves the readers and writers
(producer-consumer) concurrency problem using classic monitor synchronization
with `synchronized`, `wait()`, and `notifyAll()`.

## Files
- `MyCircularBuffer.java`: Implements a thread-safe circular buffer.
- `MyCircularBufferTest.java`: Tests the buffer using multiple reader and writer threads.

## Compilation and Execution
Compile the program using:

Run the program using:

## Description
The circular buffer blocks writers when the buffer is full and blocks readers when
the buffer is empty. Threads are synchronized using Java monitors, ensuring mutual
exclusion and correct coordination between concurrent threads.

This implementation follows the concepts discussed in the module on concurrent
programs and the Java multithreading circular buffer example.
